# Hi there :tada:

  * I study computer science at the University of LÃ¼beck :books:
  * In love with NestJs, Prisma, GraphQL & Microservice-Architecture for the backend :electric_plug:
  * Would always choose a stack similar to NextJs (React), Tailwind Css & Framer Motion for the frontend :fireworks:
